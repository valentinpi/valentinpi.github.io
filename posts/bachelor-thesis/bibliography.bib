  abstract     = {Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector b, find a vector x such that Ax=b. We consider the case where one doesn't need to know the solution x itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with x, e.g., x'Mx for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N by N and has condition number kappa, classical algorithms can find x and estimate x'Mx in O(N sqrt(kappa)) time. Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for this task that runs in poly(log N, kappa) time, an exponential improvement over the best classical algorithm.},

  abstract    = {We propose an iterative improvement method for the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to solve a linear system of equations. This is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. The accuracy is essential to solve the linear system of equations. However, the accuracy of the HHL algorithm is limited by the number of quantum bits used to express the eigenvalues of the matrix. Our iterative method improves the accuracy of the HHL solutions, and gives higher accuracy which surpasses the accuracy limited by the number of quantum bits. In practical HHL algorithm, a huge number of measurements is required to obtain good accuracy, even if we provide a sufficient number of quantum bits for the eigenvalue expression, since the solution is statistically processed from the measurements. Our improved iterative method can reduce the number of measurements. Moreover, the sign information for each eigenstate of the solution is lost once the measurement is made, although the sign is significant. Therefore, the na\"ive iterative method of the HHL algorithm may slow down, especially, when the solution includes wrong signs. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an improved iterative method for the HHL algorithm that is robust against the sign information loss, in terms of the number of iterations and the computational accuracy.},

The problem of solving a system of linear equations has a wide scope of applications, and thus HHL constitutes an important algorithmic primitive. In these notes, we present the HHL algorithm and its improved versions in detail, including explanations of the constituent sub- routines. More specifically, we discuss various quantum subroutines such as quantum phase estimation and amplitude amplification, as well as the important question of loading data into a quantum computer, via quantum RAM. The improvements to the original algorithm exploit variable-time amplitude amplification as well as a method for implementing linear combinations of unitary operations (LCUs) based on a decomposition of the operators using Fourier and Chebyshev series. Finally, we discuss a linear solver based on the quantum singular value estimation (QSVE) subroutine.},

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), for solving linear systems on near-term quantum computers. VQLS seeks to variationally prepare $|x\rangle$ such that $A|x\rangle\propto|b\rangle$. We derive an operationally meaningful termination condition for VQLS that allows one to guarantee that a desired solution precision $\epsilon$ is achieved. Specifically, we prove that $C \geq \epsilon^2 / \kappa^2$, where $C$ is the VQLS cost function and $\kappa$ is the condition number of $A$. We present efficient quantum circuits to estimate $C$, while providing evidence for the classical hardness of its estimation. Using Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement VQLS up to a problem size of $1024\times1024$. Finally, we numerically solve non-trivial problems of size up to $2^{50}\times2^{50}$. For the specific examples that we consider, we heuristically find that the time complexity of VQLS scales efficiently in $\epsilon$, $\kappa$, and the system size $N$.},

This paper outlines a new approach that avoids this conflict. We define a new block cipher, the BES , that uses only simple algebraic operations in GF (2^8). Yet the AES can be regarded as being identical to the BES with a restricted message space and key space, thus enabling the AES to be realised solely using simple algebraic operations in one field GF (2^8). This permits the exploration of the AES within a broad and rich setting. One consequence is that AES encryption can be described by an extremely sparse overdetermined multivariate quadratic system over GF (2^8), whose solution would recover an AES key.},

In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm to decide whether a Boolean equation system FS has a solution and compute one if FS does have solutions with any given success probability. The runtime complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the size of FS and the condition number of FS. As a consequence, we give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving Boolean equation systems if their condition numbers are small, say polynomial in the size of FS. We apply our quantum algorithm for solving Boolean equations to the cryptanalysis of several important cryptosystems: the stream cipher Trivum, the block cipher AES, the hash function SHA-3/Keccak, and the multivariate public key cryptosystems, and show that they are secure under quantum algebraic attack only if the condition numbers of the corresponding equation systems are large. This leads to a new criterion for designing cryptosystems that can against the attack of quantum computers: their corresponding equation systems must have large condition numbers.},

If $A$ is sparse and well-conditioned, their algorithm runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(\log N, 1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output state. We improve this to an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, exponentially improving the dependence on precision while keeping essentially the same dependence on other parameters. Our algorithm is based on a general technique for implementing any operator with a suitable Fourier or Chebyshev series representation. This allows us to bypass the quantum phase estimation algorithm, whose dependence on $\epsilon$ is prohibitive.},

Here we first review some key aspects of the algorithm from the standpoint of finding its efficient quantum circuit implementation using only elementary quantum operations, which is important for determining the potential usefulness of the algorithm in practical settings. Then we present a small-scale quantum circuit that solves a 2x2 linear system. The quantum circuit uses only 4 qubits, implying a tempting possibility for experimental realization. Furthermore, the circuit is numerically simulated and its performance under different circuit parameter settings is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation whose complexity is optimal (up to log factors) as a function of all parameters of interest. Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $\tau$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$.},

  abstract    = {The algorithmic error of digital quantum simulations is usually explored in terms of the spectral norm distance between the actual and ideal evolution operators. In practice, this worst-case error analysis may be unnecessarily pessimistic. To address this, we develop a theory of average-case performance of Hamiltonian simulation with random initial states. We relate the average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods. As applications, we estimate average-case error for digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and $k$-local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with $n$ spins, the error is quadratically reduced from $\mathcal O(n)$ in the worst case to $\mathcal O(\sqrt{n})$ on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method. Numerical evidence suggests that this theory accurately characterizes the average error for concrete models. We also apply our results to error analysis in the simulation of quantum scrambling.},

  abstract     = {Consider a Boolean function $\chi: X \to \{0,1\}$ that partitions set $X$ between its good and bad elements, where $x$ is good if $\chi(x)=1$ and bad otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

This improves the complexity of the sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm of Berry, Ahokas, Cleve, and Sanders, which scales like (d^4(log* N)||Ht||)^{1+o(1)}. To achieve this, we decompose a general sparse Hamiltonian into a small sum of Hamiltonians whose graphs of non-zero entries have the property that every connected component is a star, and efficiently simulate each of these pieces.},
